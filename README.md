This software must be run locally with a set of terminal commands.

Step 1: cd to the backend 
  - Activate your virtual environment with this command: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  - Start the flask server: python app.py (Or just press the run button!)

Step 2: Open a 2nd powershell window/terminal and cd to frontend
  - Start a local webserver with: python -m http.server 5173
  - We will be sticking with server "5173" for the duration of this project

  - and paste: http://127.0.0.1:5173
